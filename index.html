    <h1>Basketball 101 for Idiots:made by idiots</h1>
    <p>Always dribble ahead of you because it makes sense. You can try and dribble behind you but would that really make sense? Probably not. Here's how you dribble:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Put basketball in hand</li>
      <li>2. Put ball on floor</li>
      <li>3. Repeat</li>
    </ul>
